# dragon_compiler_go
Compiler written in Go by following along with the Dragon Book.

Building a simple compiler by following the famous Dragon Book (Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools).

Go was chosen as the language since it would give me some useful practice with the language, it has easy testing features built-in to the Go Tool, and I don't enjoy Java (and it would be too easy just copying the book).
